A tiny program that helps you get to bed by locking your computer for a while at a set time of night.

## Motivation

I am chronically terrible at stopping what I'm doing at night and going to bed!

## Install

```bash
./scripts/build && sudo ./scripts/install
```

## Test

To run a manual test:

```bash
./scripts/test
```

## Todo

- Pause media / mute when locking
- Publish package to Arch User Repository
- Restart automatically when config is changed
- Support multiple lockdown periods
- Support Windows
- Support MacOS
- Support other Linux init systems
